Instead of using free online images, I tried myhand in photography and photographed some of the watches my wife and I own. I uploaded the images to my Laptop and dragged the images into the images folder. 

User Experience/Features:

The first page of the website showcases the products with a caption "The home of Luxury Watches". The image is showcasing Mens watches, this is for a reson which is explained further down. A grey header to lightly highlight the functionality of the website. 'Luxury' as the home button  a with 'Men' and 'ladies' section. The 'about us' is the section whereby is advertises the brand and the companies goals, this gives you more of a feel about their mission. 

The Mens layout is to the point. the products they have and simple explanation, the make of the watch followed by a PayPal buy now button. The button is linked to a PayPal sandbox account which moves to another browser when clicked. 

The Ladies section is identical to the Mens section, its to the point with make and model that had a PayPal button under each item that is linked to a PayPal sandbox account which moves to another browser when clicked. 

The about us page is the brand, nice and simple which allows the user to see exactly what the objective is, objective being that its not just about the sale of a watch but the sale of a luxury rist band that also gives 10% to a worthy cause, a childrens charity of your choice. It will also give the company more of an edge that overshadows the competition. Here is where you will see updates of the effects the charitable dontations bring to the life's of those in need. 

The structure of each page is the same to allow the user to understand from the start how to mave around the website. 

The footer is a bootstrap card, the reason I chose this option is becasuse it works well and I wanted to try the bootstrap code. The social media icons are from fontawesome which is surrounded by a h ref link that directs the user to that respective site. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. Each link moves to another browser when clicked. The footer also contains a conatct us link, The reason its at the bottom and not powering on header is so it gives the user an interest to have a look around without giving them the option to reach out to the company. The 'contact us' link moved to a page where the user can enter a name and email address to be conatcted by the company. There is also a phone number they can call. 

The conatct us page has the second power image, however, on purpose, its not supposed to be mobile optimised as the image is supposed to showcase the Ladies watches in the background. It has the option to submit an email address and telephone number which will request the company to call the customer. 

On moving to Mobile, the model of the watch disapears along with the 'our other platforms below' content in the footer. 

Building to platform:

I am using Github and Gitpod to create the server environment to allow the coding of the website. 
Bootstrap will be used in order to ensure a mobile optimised environment. 
HTML will be the main feature, bootstrap will determine the structure and CSS will be used to style.
I used a boostrap header navagation system to allow a hamburger dropdown when moved to mobile. 

The initial index.html file was created using the shift+apstraphy+tab that created the main struture of the code, Html, body etc. I chose code from w3schools to confirm if the index.html and css pages were linked. success. 

I placed bootstrap 4.0.0 link in the html and tested it, success. 

I added all images to the umages folder and tested that the location source of the images worked. This took a few attempts to ensure I had the correct location, I tried:
../images/The-Full-Collection.jpg
images/The-Full-Collection.jpg
/images/The-Full-Collection.jpg
../assets/images.The-Full-Collection.jpg
Ite not the correct testing order but in the end, I figured this out: /assets/images/The-Full-Collection.jpg, success.

The html was added as an update. 

A header/body/footer was added with help from bootstrap and Code institue tutorials. I used the same code to place the image as was used in the bootstrap tutorial, I used the styling to make sure it was positioned the same as I liked this method. 
    -webkit-background-size: cover;
    justify-content: center;	        
    -moz-background-size: cover;
    -o-background-size: cover;
    background-size: cover;
I used a bootstrap card to taylor the footer. 

Once the stucutre was completed, well I though it was, I created the other pages of the website. I duplicated the index.html for a Men.html, Ladies.html and conatct.html. 

Styling....
